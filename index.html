        <div class="biography">
          <p>
            Contemporary Japanese writer Haruki Murakami is an author of novels, short stories, essays, and nonfiction. His works have been bestsellers in Japan and across the world. Influenced by American writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Raymond Chandler, and
            Richard Brautigan, Murakami's stories have often been described as surrealistic and melancholic, and they stand out from the Japanese literary establishment. </p>

          <p> Born in Kyoto in 1949, Murakami studied drama at Waseda University in Tokyo, where he met his wife, Yoko. The two married and upon graduating ran a jazz bar called “Peter Cat” from 1974 to 1981. After a burst of inspiration at a baseball game,
            Murakami wrote his debut novel, <cite> Hear the Wind Sing </cite> (1979), which won a contest for first novels. He continued with <cite> Pinball, 1973 </cite> (1980) and then <cite> A Wild Sheep Chase </cite> (1983), which brought him critical
            renown. Meanwhile he closed his bar and became a fulltime writer.
